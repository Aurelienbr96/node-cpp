# node-cpp

Simple project to test how to call a CPP file from a JS file using node api (napi)
The CPP function take a string from a JS module which will move files from /Download to /Desktop

In the future I will make different example on how to handle different data types

Arrays,
Int,
Javascript objects

And how to integrate bigger CPP programs.
